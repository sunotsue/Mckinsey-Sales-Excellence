# Mckinsey-Sales-Excellence

In January 2018, I participated in the Mckinsey - Sales Excellence Hackathon hosted online on AnalyticsVihdya. Out of the 2821 participants, I ranked **265th on the Public Leaderboard** with a score of **0.7459839209**, but didn't make it to the Private Leaderboard.
In this repository, you'll find details on how I've applied data preprocessing/feature engineering and decision tree techniques to forecast the digital conversion rate for a bank. 
Following are the information regarding the competition (https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/mckinsey-analytics-online-hackathon-ii/).

### Problem Statement 
A digital arm of a bank faces challenges with lead conversions. The primary objective of this division is to increase customer acquisition through digital channels. The division was set up a few years back and the primary focus of the division over these years has been to increase the number of leads getting into the conversion funnel. They source leads through various channels like search, display, email campaigns and via affiliate partners. As expected, they see differential conversion depending on the sources and the quality of these leads.

They now want to identify the leads' segments having a higher conversion ratio (lead to buying a product) so that they can specifically target these potential customers through additional channels and re-marketing. They have provided a partial data set for salaried customers from the last 3 months. They also capture basic details about customers. We need to identify the segment of customers with a high probability of conversion in the next 30 days.
